## About Me
Hello! I'm Omar Figueroa, a full-time undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). My immersion in Computer Science opened with a fascination for how logic can build tangible tools, programs, and systems we use daily. I love learning about Computer Science and seeing the many ways it can be applied.

Previously, I interned at UIC on a project to introduce AI into Computer Science courses and enhance Piazza's functionality for instructors. I primarily worked as a Backend Engineer Intern. During this internship, I was exposed to many new technologies, such as Google Cloud Platform, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker. I worked on intermediary parts of the automation process, such as parsing information and enabling easy access to it. I also worked on fine-tuning AI models through prompt engineering. This experience gave me a better insight into how coordinated teams work within the industry to ensure cooperation and openness.

Given my current interest in learning algorithm efficiency optimization and data structures in depth, I decided to pursue a Teaching Assistant role as a Data Structures TA. I find teaching fulfilling, and it continually helps me learn the concepts more thoroughly and strengthen my understanding. Apart from the technical aspect, this role has been fundamental in developing my soft skills. I've learned to adapt my communication method to support a varied cohort of over 250 students per semester, turning challenging and surprising questions into learning moments.

As I look toward my goal of becoming a Software Engineer, I am currently focusing on project-based learning to deepen my knowledge. To be more specific, I want to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build Frontend applications and showcase impressive projects in the future. My current plan is to become more active here on GitHub and document my progress.

## Currently Working On
* **Improving my Frontend Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
* [Trivia Quiz App](https://github.com/Omarf8/trivia-quiz-app) - A simple project using JavaScript to get familiar with DOM manipulation and API fetching.

## ⚡️ Skills
* **Languages:** C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SwiftUI
* **Testing & Memory:** GoogleTest, AddressSanitizer (ASan)
* **Tools & Build Systems:** JavaFX, Git, Maven
