**I'm always eager to learn new strategies, tools, and best practices. Lately, I've started working on visual, interactive projects using modern Frontend frameworks instead of just terminal-based tools.**

## About Me
Hello! I'm Omar Figueroa, a full-time undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). My immersion in Computer Science opened with a fascination for how logic can build tangible tools, programs, and systems we use daily. I love learning about Computer Science and seeing the many ways it can be applied.

Previously, I interned at UIC on a project to introduce AI into Computer Science courses and enhance Piazza's functionality for instructors. I primarily worked as a Backend Engineer Intern. During this internship, I was exposed to many new technologies, such as Google Cloud Platform, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker. I worked on intermediary parts of the automation process, such as parsing information and enabling easy access to it. I also worked on fine-tuning AI models through prompt engineering. This experience gave me a better insight into how coordinated teams work within the industry to ensure cooperation and openness.

Given my current interest in learning algorithm efficiency and data structures in depth, I decided to pursue a Teaching Assistant role as a Data Structures TA. I find teaching fulfilling, and it continually helps me learn the concepts more thoroughly and strengthen my own understanding. Apart from the technical aspect, this role has been fundamental in developing my soft skills. I've learned to adapt my communication method to support a varied cohort of over 250 students per semester, turning challenging and surprising questions into learning moments.

My goal is to become a Software Engineer, so I'm focusing on project-based learning to build my skills. Right now, I'm learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create Frontend applications and showcase my work. I also plan to be more active on GitHub and share my progress at each step.

## Currently Working On
* **Improving my Frontend Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
* [Trivia Quiz App](https://github.com/Omarf8/trivia-quiz-app) - A simple project using JavaScript to get familiar with DOM manipulation and API fetching.

## ⚡️ Skills
* **Languages:** C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SwiftUI
* **Testing & Memory:** GoogleTest, AddressSanitizer (ASan)
* **Tools & Build Systems:** JavaFX, Git, Maven
